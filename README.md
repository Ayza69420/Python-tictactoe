# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses.I made this game in the programming language [python](https://www.python.org)
